%%%Interesting AND answer WHAT CSE, WHY prediciting behaviour in order to reccommend actions, HOW Simulation!
The Greek philosopher Plutarch proposed in his work \textit{Life of Theseus} a paradox that is in essence the question\footnote{The actual question asked was whether Theseus's ship, which was restored by replacing all wooden parts, remained the same ship.}:
\begin{quote}
If an object has all its component parts replaced, is it the same object?
\end{quote}
This question addresses many themes including how objects are made of components, how they change their component parts,
and how this change effects the object in question.

Like the object in Plutarch's question, a software system can be constructed from components and changed by altering its composition.
A \textbf{component system} can be constructed by composing together software components \citep{Szyperski2002},
and the process by which a software system changes over time is called \textbf{software evolution} \citep{lehman1980}.
The focus of this research is \textbf{component system evolution} (CSE), which is the process by which a component system changes over time.
A component system is changed by altering its composition of components and \textbf{evolves} through repeated changes.

\section{Motivation}
%%%Why research this?

An example of a popular component system is the Ubuntu GNU/Linux operating system, which has an estimated 20 million users\footnote{http://www.ubuntu.com/, accessed 16/5/2012}. 
Another example of a component system is the Eclipse IDE, which is used by thousands of companies and millions of users\footnote{http://www.eclipse.org/org/community\_survey/Eclipse\_Survey\_2011\_Report.pdf, \\accessed 29/5/2012}.
Ubuntu and Eclipse systems are constructed from components, called packages and bundles respectively, 
and can be changed by adding, removing and upgrading components.
Repeatedly applying such changes allows Ubuntu and Eclipse systems to evolve through the CSE process.
By studying the CSE process,
this research has the potential to impact millions of users and their systems.

\section{Objective}
%%%What do I want to find out?
The objective of this research is to study the process of component system evolution and its effects.
The primary effects that are focused on are the amount of change made to systems and how out-of-date the systems become over time.
In section \ref{strat.usersurvey}, these two effects are argued to be the users' primary concerns during CSE.
Through understanding this change and out-of-dateness,
this research aims to inform developers and users of the consequences their choices have on evolving systems,
and reduce these negative effects.

The objective of this research has lead to the thesis:
\begin{quote}
\textit{It is possible to reduce the negative effects of component system evolution by altering the mechanisms by which systems are changed.} 
\end{quote}

The necessary steps to validate this thesis are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item To develop a reproducible and controllable environment in which to measure the effects of CSE.
  \item To use this environment to study how systems evolve.
  \item To alter the mechanisms of evolution and study their impact on CSE.
  \item To define methods to reduce change and out-of-dateness and demonstrate their effect.
\end{itemize}

Once these steps are completed, this thesis will be shown to be supported.  

\section{Research Method}
%%%How are we going to study CSE?
To study the evolution of a single component system, all changes to that system over a period of time must be examined.
Additionally, to gain a broad and useful perspective of CSE characteristics, the evolution of many systems must be studied.
To this end, this research simulates the evolution of many Ubuntu systems.
The reason for selecting Ubuntu and simulation as the method of study are detailed further in this section.

\subsection{Why Ubuntu?}
The Ubuntu operating system was selected as the component system to study CSE for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
  \item It has significant size and complexity which ensures that the results will not be trivial.
  \item It has an active research community whose results can be used and built upon.
  \item It has an estimated 20 million users, potentially allowing the outcomes of this research to have a significant impact.
  \item There are many open resources of information available to be collected and used for simulation.
\end{itemize} 

Another important question is ``Why only Ubuntu?'', 
as only focusing on the evolution of one component system may make the results from this research non-generalisable.
There are many similarities between component models (some are discussed in section \ref{background.models})
including the relationships between components and the mechanisms used to change component systems.
These similarities may make many of the contributions from this research component system independent.

Another factor in the decision to only simulate the evolution of Ubuntu systems was the significant effort invested in the collection of data.
This effort was reduced because of Ubuntu's open nature and active community that provided tools and resources to be used.
It may be more difficult to collect equally valid data for other component systems because they are typically not as open or have such an active community as Ubuntu.
To simulate these systems would then be an additional, considerable effort.
Therefore, the simulation of other types of component system is not within the scope of this research,
however the simulation of further component systems is proposed as future research in section \ref{conclusion.futurework}.

\subsection{Why Simulate?}
The method selected to study CSE is to model its relevant aspects, then simulate the evolution of many Ubuntu systems.
This method was selected as a simulation provides the necessary control over the variables of CSE to validate the thesis.
Other methods, e.g. collecting information from real systems, will not enable for the study of novel techniques that a simulation allows.

The core hurdle in creating a simulation is ensuring that the returned results are similar enough to reality to draw meaningful conclusions, i.e. the simulation is valid.
In this context:
\begin{quotation}
``\textit{Validation} is the process of determining whether a simulation is an accurate representation of the system, for the particular object of the study.'' \citep{Law2005}
\end{quotation}

The methodology that \cite{Law2005} outlines was selected because it gave practical guidance to creating and using a valid simulation.
The methodology was created after the observation that validation was often ``attempted after the simulation models had already been developed'' \citep{Law2005}.
It was also observed was that non-validated simulations can produce erroneous information that leads to bad, possibly costly decisions being made.

This methodology has a seven step approach to creating a valid simulation:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Step 1: Formulate the problem}: %Intro, Background and Formal Models of the problem
	The problem should be described as clearly as possible.
	The core artifacts at this stage are the overall objectives and the scope of the study.
\item \textbf{Step 2: Collect information/data to construct a conceptual model}: %Simulation
	The conceptual model is a description of how the simulation and system work in relation to the study's objectives.
	It contains all variables used to configure the simulation. 
\item \textbf{Step 3: Validate the conceptual model}: %Simulation
	The validation of the conceptual model is accomplished through interviews and discussions with the stakeholders of the study.
\item \textbf {Step 4: Implement the conceptual model}: % implementation and Ubuntu simulation --describing where the 
	The implementation of the conceptual model must be executed and documented in a way that allows others to replicate and repeat the process.
\item \textbf{Step 5: Validate the simulation implementation}: %Through MISC
	The most definitive way to validate a simulation is to compare its results to those from an actual system \citep{Law2005}.
\item \textbf{Step 6: Design, conduct and analyse experiments} :
	Experiments use the simulation to measure effects and test hypothesises. 
	For each of the experiments, the configuration and number of independent runs must be defined.
\item \textbf{Step 7: Document and present results}:
	This presentation is required to promote the future re-use of the models, through describing the validation process.
\end{itemize}

The above described methodology was created for large scale industrial projects with a substantial resources available.
It describes the employment and use of experts and analysts to ensure validity.
The available resources for this project is fewer than these large scale projects, therefore some of the steps have been decreased in scope.
This may reduce the validity of the final simulation, but these restrictions have been made only when necessary,
and done so in a manner that attempts to minimise negative effects.

\section{Contributions}
As stated above, CSE is studied through simulating the evolution of Ubuntu systems guided by the methodology outlined by \cite{Law2005}.
The simulation artifacts, the alterations defined to reduce negative effects during CSE, 
and results from the simulation are all contributions of this research. 
These contributions are:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A formal model \textbf{\modelname} (\textbf{Co}mponent \textbf{Sy}stem \textbf{E}volution) that describes CSE. 
  \item The \textbf{CUDF* syntax} that is used to define documents that describe the evolution of a component system.
  \item \textbf{\usermodel} (\textbf{Sim}ulated \textbf{User}) that models a user that changes their system.
  \item The \textbf{GJSolver} which is an efficient implementation that calculates the changes made to a system as it evolves (called resolving).
	GJSolver was independently validated through the MISC competition hosted by the Mancoosi project\footnote{http://www.mancoosi.org/, accessed 8/8/2012}. 
  \item A \textbf{simulation of the evolution of Ubuntu operating systems} using \modelname, CUDF*, \usermodel and GJSolver.
  \item The defined methods to reduce the out-of-dateness and change during CSE. 
  \item The results, analysis and conclusions from experiments using the simulation.
\end{enumerate}

These contributions overlap with published papers from thsi research:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item An empirical study into the search space of resolving component systems \citep{Jenson2010} in the proceedings of Component Based Software Engineering (CBSE) 2010.
  \item A formal framework to describe the user preferences during CSE \citep{Jenson2010a} in the proceedings of Asia/Pacific Software Engineering Conference (APSEC) 2010.
  \item An empirical study into the evolution of component systems \citep{jenson2011} in the proceedings of CBSE 2011.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Thesis Overview}
This thesis is organised and presented in the order that resembles the steps of the above described methodology:
the problem is described (chapter \ref{background}), the models are presented and validated (chapters \ref{formal} and \ref{simulation}),
the implementation and validation of the simulation are described (chapter \ref{implementation}), and the experiments and their results are discussed (chapter \ref{experiments}).  

Chapter \ref{background} explores the backgrounds of CSE and its related domains.
This aims to put CSE in historical context and to give a suitable definitions to the elements of CSE.

Chapter \ref{formal} presents the \modelname model and the CUDF* syntax that describe the formal aspects of the evolution of component systems.
\modelname is used to describe the evolution of a component system and CUDF* is used as the syntax to serialise \modelname instances.

Chapter \ref{simulation} presents the \usermodel model which is used to describe users that request changes to their component systems.
This model includes assumptions and variables that are necessary to simulate the evolution of Ubuntu systems. 
It is developed from the results of a conducted survey.
As this model relies on many assumptions that may impact the validity of the simulation, the validation of this model is also discussed. 

Chapter \ref{implementation} describes the algorithms used to create the GJSolver implementation.
The resolving of a component system can require significant computational effort,
therefore the algorithms and implementation used are an important aspect of research.
The verification of GJSolver and validation of the simulation are also discussed in this chapter.

Chapter \ref{experiments} describes the experiments, results and analysis that are conducted using the developed simulation.
The effects examined are the changes that the systems go through, and how out-of-date the systems become during evolution.
Through these experiments, causes of additional change and out-of-dateness are identified.
These causes are addressed with some novel changes to CSE, and through using the simulation the impact of these changes is measured.
The effects of these changes are measured using the simulation and are shown to have benefits during CSE.

This thesis concludes in chapter \ref{conclusion} by describing the contributions of this research and possible future research.
