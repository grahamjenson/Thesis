\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
%%%The conclusions from this work are made the use of Component dependency resolution

%%%The increased use of component Dependency Resolution in component models, as they mature the requirements that they must satisfy

%%%The way in which components depend on each other must be an important issue when defining component models as it will effect the use of resolution

%%%Initial Investigation conclusions

%%%Simulation Conclusions

%%%Final thoughts

\section{Related Work}
%%%Mancoosi is by far the most related work, though its focus is slightly different

%%%Daniel Le Beere and Pascal Rapicault making EclipseP2 P2CUDF and Sat4J are all very related

%%%Lehmans Laws of Evolution inspired our research into Component System Evolution

%%%

\section{Future Work}
%%%Future work may be looking at different component models, and the application of CDR to them (e.g. Web Services)

%%%Changing Debian packages to have more standard composition, to make change less risky
