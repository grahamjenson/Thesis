\chapter{Initial Investigations}
%%%These investigations outline the first 

\section{Detailed comparison of OSGi and Debian}
%%%Here we will discuss various static graph analysis, between the OSGi component model and the Debian component model

\subsection{Graph analysis}
%%%Distributions of dependencies...

\section{Search Space Size}
%%%Here we analyise the size of the possible search spaces of both OSGi and Debian, through the simple mechanism of brute force search

\section{SAT solver optimisation}
%%%We change some of the different variables in the SAT solver (constraint resolution, oredering, ...) and analize the domain specific results

\section{Conclusions}
%%%Here we can go over the siilarities and differences between the two component models (hopefuly the are similar enough)
