\section{Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) Solver}
%%%In this chapeter we describe an effecient and popular solution to the CDR problem, the SAT solver (EDOS PAPER)

%%%First we define the SAT problem

%%%Then discuss its Complexity (NP complete if it the problem satisfies some criteria)


\subsection{Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland algorithm for SAT Solvers}
%%%A successful algorithm for solving SAT problems is the DPLL algorithm, here we describe it in overview

%%%Some improvements over tie

\subsection{CHAFF Watched Literals}

\subsection{Conflict Learning}
%%%Simple resolution as proposed by Stallman was an effecient means to stop thrashing(looking at the same subtree repeatedly) constraints

%%%Improvement of this resolution can be made by finding smaller constraints, this can be accomplished by eliminating literals in a constraint

%%%Further improvement can be made by searching for the smallest constraint through such variable elimination

\subsection{Literal Order}
%%%The order in which the literals are assumed in the DPLL algorithm, is heuristically accomplished
