[F]or the present purposes, with the accuracy we want at first, we dont have to be very careful about defining the things very precicly. 
You say "That is a terrible thing! I learnt in science you must define everthing precicly." You cannot define anything precicly! 
Otherwise you get in that paralysis of thought that comes in philosophers that sit opposite each other and one says to the other, 
"You don't know what you are talking about." The other says "What do you mean by know? What do you mean by speech? What do you mean by you?" and so on.
In order to agree to talk we just have to agree we are talking about roughly the same thing!

What I cannot create, I do not understand.
Richard Feynman: On his blackboard at time of death in 1988; as quoted in The Universe in a Nutshell by Stephen Hawking

I have approximate answers and possible beliefs in different degrees of certainty about different things, but I'm not absolutely sure of anything,

"A model is a physical, mathematical, or logical representation of a system entity, phenomenon, or process. A simulation is the implementation of a model over time. A simulation brings a model to life and shows how a particular object or phenomenon will behave. It is useful for testing, analysis or training where real-world systems or concepts can be represented by a model."
