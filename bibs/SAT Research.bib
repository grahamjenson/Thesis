abstract = {In this articleExtended version available at http://www.cs.chalmers.se/$\sim$een, we present a small, complete, and efficient SAT-solver in the style of conflict-driven learning, as exemplified by . We aim to give sufficient details about implementation to enable the reader to construct his or her own solver in a very short time. This will allow users of SAT-solvers to make domain specific extensions or adaptions of current state-of-the-art SAT-techniques, to meet the needs of a particular application area. The presented solver is designed with this in mind, and includes among other things a mechanism for adding arbitrary boolean constraints. It also supports solving a series of related SAT-problems efficiently by an incremental SAT-interface.},
