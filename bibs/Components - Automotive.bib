abstract = {In the automotive industry, the compilation and maintenance of correct product configuration data is a complex task. Our work shows how formal methods can be applied to the validation of such business critical data. Our consistency support tool BIS works on an existing database of Boolean constraints expressing valid configurations and their transformation into manufacturable products. Using a specially modified satisfiability checker with an explanation component, BIS can detect inconsistencies in the constraints set and thus help increase the quality of the product data. BIS also supports manufacturing decisions by calculating the implications of product or production environment changes on the set of required parts. In this paper, we give a comprehensive account of BIS: the formalization of the business processes underlying its construction, the modifications of satisfiability-checking technology we found necessary in this context, and the software technology used to package the product as a clientâ€“server information system.},
