@book{Gancarz2003,
abstract = {"The concept of Linux and the GNU project, while appearing to be the 'next step' of the Unix Philosophy, is only the return from a wayward path. Everything stated in the Unix Philosophy's first edition is just as true today, perhaps even more so. The addition of source code availability allows you to see exactly how these masters of code created their systems, and challenges you to create even faster code with greater capabilities." -Jon "maddog" Hall, Executive Director, Linux International"By effectively linking the principles used in Unix with those used by the Linux development community, Gancarz sheds new light on the Open Source philosophy." -Henry L. Hall, CEO, Wild Open SourceUnlike so many books that focus on how to use Linux, Linux and the Unix Philosophy explores the "way of thinking that is Linux" and why Linux is a superior implementation of this highly capable operating system.This book is a revision and expansion of a computer science classic. Every chapter has been thoroughly updated with Linux coverage.Linux and the Unix Philosophy falls squarely between the "softer" texts on iterative software design and project management and the "how-to" technical texts. Thus far, no one has come out with a book that addresses this topic, either in the Unix space or the Linux space. Linux and the Unix Philosophy covers the same ground as the first edition, while it also presents bold new ideas about Linux and Open Source.· Concise list of philosophy tenets makes it a handy quick reference· Anecdotal examples personalize the book for the reader· Conversational style makes it easy and joyful to read},

abstract = {The comprehensive guide to builing Eclipse Plug-Ins that explains a highly effective software design philosophy. Written by two worldclass programmers and software designers - Kent Beck and Eric Gamma! This book explains how to extend Eclipse for software projects and how to use Eclipse to create software tools that improve development time and shows how to create our software productivity Tools using insightful examples. This book encourages tool building by laying bare the design of an excellent tool platform, Eclipse, and encourages design by building a typical tool extending Eclipse. This tutorial on creating custom tools also provides an explanation of a highly effective software design philosophy. The authors revive the lost art of supporting existing work by building tools. This book improves the software developers skill set by building little tools, and gradually growing those tools into better-than-professional quality products to help a whole community of developers. This book revives that highly-effective practice of tool writing and provides lessons along the way that tool building and design are two of the most leveraged skills for software developers.},
