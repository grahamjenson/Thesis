%TODO good quote about breaking a problem into smaller simpiler parts
When confronted with a large complex system, the first instinct, in an attempt to understand it, is to break it into smaller, simpler units, 
then examine each part individually while trying to understand the relationships between them.
Through doing this a complex system as a whole is able to be grasped through layers of abstraction.
Looking at the human anatomy, we can look at the nervous system, the cardiovascular system, the muscles, the skeleton \ldots,
each individual part with a distinct function and interactions with other parts.
Understanding a system as a set of units and interactions gives us tools for the study and maintenance of problems.  

In complex software systems, understanding the entire system as a set of parts with relationships has many of the same benefits analogous to the anatomy example.
%Specialization, Maintenance and problem detection, concurrent development, effect analysis
It allows specialization, 
by splitting the system into parts experts in those parts can focus on their own domain and only have to know how it interacts with other parts.

This same method is used when creating complex systems, first we divide the parts into individual functional units,
then define the relationships between the units.


Component Software consoldates code into units


\section{Overview of Thesis}
First Background,
Then define what a component is based on literature and examples

\chapter{Background}

\section{What is a Component?}
Discuss what a component is and who defines it as such

Give examples of OSGi Bundles, Eclipse Plugins, DS
Spring DM
Debian Packages
Maven POM
CUDF

Discuss differences and commonalities
Multiple package installations Maven Debain No, OSGi Eclipse DS and CUDF yes
Focus on interface not implementation dependence, Maven no, Debian Community defined virtual packages, 
OSGi kind of package name space related to installation, Eclipse Yes DS Yes.
Version Control, All Yes
Run time replacement Dynamic Dependence, Maven no (no runtime), Eclipse Kind of a bit buggy requires restarts,
OSGI DS Debian Yes, CUDF is abstract so has no real implementation
Conflicts, Maven?, Spring and DS no,  OSGi Singleton, Debian and CUDF are Expressive
Reccommendation, ??

\section{Component Evolution}
Versioning is the main mechanism in which components evolve.
There is also branching, and environment specific altering.

Versioning components has significant research behind it.

Branching is when a difference in opinion or idealogy on how a component should proceed into the future
causes the project to take two different routes given the same base code or idea.

Spring DM takes libraries and makes them OSGi compatable, 
Debian package can be compiled for different CPU architectures.


\section{Component System Evolution}
Version and Dynamic dependence, with focus on interface give extensive tools to the composer 
Add, remove, upgrade, downgrade components in the system while it is running.

There are some problems that must be solved within the component model like making sure that during the change,
the system is never invalid or unstable. 
This is a scheduling problem as described by %TODO

The composer must also make sure that all dependencies are meet
