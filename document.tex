\chapter{Introduction}
%%%The introduction leads to the idea of component development using the metaphor of the human body.
%%%Why do we break systems into parts, why do we build systems from parts.
%%%The eventual use of components is a natural extension of software development.

%TODO good quote about breaking a problem into smaller simpiler parts
{}When confronted with a large complex system, our first instinct in an attempt to understand it is often to break it into smaller, simpler parts, 
{}then examine each part individually while trying to understand the relationships between them.
{}Through doing this how a complex system works as a whole is able to be grasped.
{}Looking at the human anatomy, we can look at the nervous system, the cardiovascular system, the muscles, the skeleton \ldots,
{}each individual part with a distinct function and interactions with other parts.
{}Understanding a system as a set of units and interactions gives us tools for the study and maintenance of problems.  

{}In complex software systems, understanding the entire system as a set of parts with relationships has many of the same benefits analogous to the anatomy example.
%Specialization, Maintenance and problem detection, concurrent development, effect analysis
{}It allows specialization, 
{}by splitting the system into parts experts in those parts can focus on their own domain and only have to know how it interacts with other parts.

{}This same method is used when creating complex systems, first we divide the parts into individual functional units,
{}then define the relationships between the units.
