\chapter{Background}
%%%The history of components, a small summary of the intro of the Szypersky book

\section{What is a Component?}
%%%Discuss what a component is and how it is defined by its goals and not it's properties.

A component is best defined as
\quote{A unit that can be composed}
This is a complete, but useless definition for our purposes, 
as Szyperski noted, a natural concept such as component is best defined by its goals not it's properties. %TODO


Give examples of OSGi Bundles, Eclipse Plugins, DS
Spring DM
Debian Packages
Maven POM
CUDF

Discuss differences and commonalities
Multiple package installations Maven Debain No, OSGi Eclipse DS and CUDF yes
Focus on interface not implementation dependence, Maven no, Debian Community defined virtual packages, 
OSGi kind of package name space related to installation, Eclipse Yes DS Yes.
Version Control, All Yes
Run time replacement Dynamic Dependence, Maven no (no runtime), Eclipse Kind of a bit buggy requires restarts,
OSGI DS Debian Yes, CUDF is abstract so has no real implementation
Conflicts, Maven?, Spring and DS no,  OSGi Singleton, Debian and CUDF are Expressive
Reccommendation, ??

\section{Component Models}
%%%We are focusing on two of the most popular component models, the OSGi and Debian component models

\subsection{Debian}

\subsection{OSGi}

\section{Component Evolution}
%%%Component evolution, changing components to newer versions
Versioning is the main mechanism in which components evolve.
There is also branching, and environment specific altering.

Versioning components has significant research behind it.

Branching is when a difference in opinion or idealogy on how a component should proceed into the future
causes the project to take two different routes given the same base code or idea.

Spring DM takes libraries and makes them OSGi compatable, 
Debian package can be compiled for different CPU architectures.


\section{Component System Evolution}
%%%Changing the component in the component systems, talk about DLL Hell, and the problems it has caused
Version and Dynamic dependence, with focus on interface give extensive tools to the composer 
Add, remove, upgrade, downgrade components in the system while it is running.

There are some problems that must be solved within the component model like making sure that during the change,
the system is never invalid or unstable. 
This is a scheduling problem as described by %TODO

The composer must also make sure that all dependencies are meet

\section{Component Dependency Resolution}
%%%The problems caused when Evolving component systems can be solved with Component Dependency Resolution.
%%%These have been used at Development time and Run time, some examples
